============

Radio Meteor is an Internet Radio player based on HTML5 and Meteorjs.
There are only ad-free radio stations, such as SomaFM and Radio Paradise.
There's also a somewhat buggy Android App.

It's playing at [radio.meteor.com](http://radio.meteor.com/)
I'd be happy to work more on this but it's already working well for me.
