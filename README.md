============

**Radio Meteor** is an Internet Radio player based on HTML5 and [Meteor](http://meteor.com).
Currently there are only ad-free radio stations, such as SomaFM and Radio Paradise. There is a plan to allow anyone to add their favorite streams.

There was a somewhat buggy Android App for a while.

It's playing at [radio.meteor.com](http://radio.meteor.com/).

It's not great but it works well for [guaka](http://twitter.com/guaka).
