============

**Radio Meteor** is an Internet Radio player based on HTML5 and
[Meteor](http://meteor.com).  Currently there are only ad-free radio
stations, such as SomaFM and Radio Paradise. There is a plan to allow
anyone to add their favorite streams.

There was a buggy Android app. There may be a working one again in the future.


It's playing at [radio.meteor.com](http://radio.meteor.com/).

It's not great but it works well for [guaka](http://twitter.com/guaka).
**Radio Meteor** is a simple Meteor app to play [Soma.fm](http://soma.fm/) and other [ad free](http://moneyless.org/tags/advertising) streams through HTML5.

Inspired by https://github.com/joe-roth/somafm-popup and the need for
a nice way to play Soma.fm streams, [Radio
Paradise](http://www.radioparadise.com/), [Radio
Fip](http://www.fipradio.fr/) and more.


**Available at [radio.meteor.com](http://radio.meteor.com/)**
