**Radio Meteor** is a simple Meteor app to play [Soma.fm](http://soma.fm/) and other [ad free](http://moneyless.org/tags/advertising) streams through HTML5.

Inspired by https://github.com/joe-roth/somafm-popup and the need for a nice way to play Soma.fm streams,
[Radio Paradise](http://www.radioparadise.com/), [Radio Fip](http://www.fipradio.fr/) and more.


**Available at [radio.meteor.com](http://radio.meteor.com/)**


There was a buggy Android app. There may be a working one again in the future.
